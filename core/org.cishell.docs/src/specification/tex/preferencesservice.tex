\chapter{Preferences Service Specification}
\label{preferencesService}
\section*{Version 1.1}
\section{Introduction}

CIShell requires OSGi's standard \class{PreferencesService} to be installed in a
CIShell-compliant system. This gives both the algorithms and the applications
built on CIShell a standard preferences storage system to use. It is used mainly
as a storage mechanism for data that is not necessarily adjustable by end-users.
Things like, last opened file, recently opened files, or any sort of data that
may need to be saved between sessions. This service has not been modified or
extended. More information about the \class{PreferencesService} is available in
the OSGi Service Platform Service Compendium Specification R4, section 106 under
``Preferences Service Specification.'' Algorithm developers wishing to expose
user-adjustable preferences, should refer to section \ref{userPrefsSpec} for
more information on this separate task.
