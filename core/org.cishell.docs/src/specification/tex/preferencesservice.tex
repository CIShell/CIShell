\section{Introduction}

CIShell requires OSGi's standard \class{PreferencesService} to be installed in a
CIShell-compliant system. This gives both the algorithms and the applications
built on CIShell a standard preferences storage sytem to use. This service has
not been extended or modified. More information about the
\class{PreferencesService} is available in the OSGi Service Platform Service
Compendium Specification R4, section 106 under ``Preferences Service
Specification''.
