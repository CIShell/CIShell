\section{Algorithm Specification}

\subsection*{\textit{Version 1.0}}

\subsection{Introduction}

The CIShell Platform has been specifically designed around the idea of the
algorithm. It is the central and most important concept. Algorithms are fully
defined and self-contained bits of execution. They can do many things from data
conversion, data analysis, and can even spawn whole external programs if needed.
Algorithms are well defined black boxes in that their input and output is
specified in each algorithm's service metadata and associated
\class{MetaTypeProvider}. Other than that, CIShell makes no attempt to understand
the algorithm.

\subsubsection{Essentials}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Application Independence} - Algorithms must be usable in a wide
  variety of contexts and should not be tied to any one CIShell environment or
  front end where possible.
  \item \textit{User Interface Independence} - Algorithms should not have to tie
  themselves to a single UI where possible.
  \item \textit{Black Box Algorithms} - Algorithms are black boxes whose
  possible interactions are described in metadata.
  \item \textit{Delayed Execution} - There may be a large delay between an
  algorithm getting parameters for execution and its actual execution.
  \item \textit{Remote Execution} - Algorithm interfaces should be designed to
  facilitate remote execution of algorithms where possible.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Operations}

To be recognized by CIShell, an \class{AlgorithmFactory} must be registered with
OSGi's service registry. The service registry requires three things when
registering: an interface (\class{AlgorithmFactory}), an implementation, and a
\class{Dictionary} of metadata. The algorithm developer provides the
implementation and metadata. The metadata helps to differentiate and define the
algorithm for search and discovery, see section \ref{algMetaData}.

An algorithm defines its inputs in two ways. First, the input data is defined in
the algorithm's service metadata. Second, the acceptable user-entered
input parameters are defined in a \class{MetaTypeProvider} and published to the
\class{MetaTypeService}.

Figure \ref{fig:algExecWorkflow} shows the typical flow of information into and
out of an algorithm. First the input parameter specification is pulled from the
\class{MetaTypeService}. If parameters are needed, then a UI is created and
user inputs are entered. To create an \class{Algorithm}, the
\class{AlgorithmFactory} is passed the user-entered parameters, zero or more
pieces of data, and a \class{CIShellContext}. The \class{Algorithm} is then
executed and produces zero or more pieces of data.

\subsection{Optional Interfaces}

Algorithm developers may augment algorithms with additional interfaces to enhance
parts of the execution workflow. See each interface's API documentation for more
details.

\begin{description}
  \item[ParameterMutator] An \class{AlgorithmFactory} can implement the
  \class{ParameterMutator} interface to add, remove, or modify an algorithm's
  input parameters between the time when its \class{MetaTypeProvider} is pulled
  from the \class{MetaTypeService} and when the corresponding UI is shown to the
  user. This is typically done to customize the input parameters based on the
  data to be given to the algorithm. See section \ref{GUISpec} for information
  on constructing and publishing \class{MetaTypeProviders}.
  
  \item[DataValidator] An \class{AlgorithmFactory} can implement the
  \class{DataValidator} interface to validate the data beyond the data format
  validation that an application should provide ahead of time.

  \item[ProgressTrackable] An \class{Algorithm} can implement
  \class{ProgressTrackable} to allow for more detailed monitoring and control
  of an \class{Algorithm}'s progress while executing.
\end{description}

\subsection{Service Metadata}
\label{algMetaData}

When an algorithm is registered with OSGi's service registry, a
\class{Dictionary} of metadata is provided. Since the algorithm itself is a black
box, the metadata is used to provide information about the algorithm. Information
such as the format of each \class{Data} item to be input and output is provided.
In addition to the mechanics of the algorithms, data such as the authors, label,
urls, citation references, and description are provided. This metadata can be
searched by anyone to find relevant algorithms using OSGi's service registry.

Each standard metadata element required by the CIShell specification is defined
below and in the interface \class{AlgorithmProperty}. It defines each key string
and the valid value strings to set in the metadata \class{Dictionary} when
registering an algorithm as a service.

\subsection*{service.pid}
A string that uniquely identifies the algorithm. The service.pid should not
change between sessions and only one algorithm with a given service.pid should
be available in the service registry at any given time. It is recommended to 
use the Java naming scheme including path for this purpose, i.e.,
``org.cishell.my.algorithm.MyAlgorithm''. This metadata element is defined
as part of the OSGi Service Platform Core Specification, section 6.1.12. 

\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
  \item[Example 1:] service.pid = org.my.algorithm.MyAlgorithm
\end{description}
\end{quote}


\subsection*{parameters\_pid} 

When this key is not set, an algorithm's user-entered input parameters are
assumed to be registered in the \class{MetaTypeService} with a persistent id
equal to the algorithm service's ``service.pid''. An algorithm can override this
by setting this key to their custom persistent id. See section \ref{GUISpec}
for information on creating and publishing input parameters.

\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
  \item[Example 1:] parameters\_pid = org.my.custom.pid.that.i.want.to.use
\end{description}
\end{quote}


\subsection*{in\_data} 
Specifies the formats and number of \class{Data} inputs the
algorithm accepts. The string is a comma separated list of data formats as
defined in section \ref{dataSpec}. If no \class{Data} inputs are necessary then
the string ``null'' or not specifying the in\_data attribute at all is valid.
If any data is optional, prefix the associated format with a ``?''. When the
\class{AlgorithmFactory.createAlgorithm} method is called with a \class{Data}
array, an optional \class{Data} element will be \class{null} if it is not
provided.

By using the ``+'', ``*'', or ``?'' prefixes, ambiguities could arise from
specifying multiple input formats that could easily fit into two or more
of the formats. An algorithm developer should take care when reading
in \class{Data} arrays from possibly ambiguous in\_data strings.

\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
  \item[Example 1:] in\_data = null
  \item[Example 2:] in\_data = java.lang.String
  \item[Example 3:] in\_data = java.lang.String, file:text/plain, file:text/xml
  \item[Example 4:] in\_data = file-ext:xml
  \item[Example 5:] in\_data = +file:text/plain, *file:text/xml,
  ?java.lang.String
  \item[Example 6:] in\_data = ?my.package.SpecialClass
\end{description}
\end{quote}


\subsection*{out\_data} 
Specifies the formats and number of \class{Data} inputs
the algorithm produces when successfully executed. The string is a comma
separated list of data formats as defined in section \ref{dataSpec}. If no
\class{Data} is output then the string ``null'' or not specifying the out\_data
attribute at all is valid. If any data is optional, prefix the associated
format with a ``?''. When producing the \class{Data} array, an optional
\class{Data} element must be \class{null} if it is not produced. 

\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
  \item[Example 1:] out\_data = null
  \item[Example 2:] out\_data = java.lang.String
  \item[Example 3:] out\_data = java.lang.String, file:text/plain, file:text/xml
  \item[Example 4:] out\_data = file-ext:csv
  \item[Example 5:] out\_data = +file:text/plain, *file:text/xml,
  ?java.lang.String
  \item[Example 6:] out\_data = ?my.package.SpecialClass
\end{description}
\end{quote}


\subsection*{parentage}
If this metadata element is used, it defines how the output \class{Data} produced
by the algorithm should be arranged. \class{Data} items can be given a parent as
part of their metadata (which usually means the \class{Data} was derived from the
referenced \class{Data}). If parentage is set to ``default'' then each of the
algorithm's output \class{Data} items will have their parent \class{Data} item
set as the first input \class{Data} item (if applicable) by the
CIShell-conforming application. If parentage is set to something else or is not
set at all, then it is up to the algorithm to set up these relationships.

\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
  \item[Example 1:] parentage = default 
\end{description}
\end{quote}


\subsection*{type} 
Specifies the type of the algorithm. If no type is set, then
it is assumed to be of ``Standard Algorithm'' type. Which metadata keys to use
and their exact meaning varies depending on the type of algorithm. The different
algorithm types and their constraints are defined in section
\ref{algConstraints}.

\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
  \item[Example 1:] type = converter
  \item[Example 2:] type = validator
  \item[Example 3:] type = dataset 
\end{description}
\end{quote}


\subsection*{remotable}
Specifies if the algorithm can be run remotely. An algorithm can be run
remotely if it only uses the services provided by the \class{CIShellContext}
and does not create its own non-\class{GUIBuilderService}-built GUI. Valid
strings are ``true'' or ``false''. If this metadata element is not set, then
it is assumed that it cannot be run remotely.

\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
  \item[Example 1:] remoteable = true 
\end{description}
\end{quote}


\subsection*{label}
Specifies a human-readable short name for the algorithm. What label is
acceptable varies depending on the type of the algorithm. 

\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
  \item[Example 1:] label = Load\ldots 
\end{description}
\end{quote}


\subsection*{description}
Provides more details on the workings of the algorithm. What
description is acceptable varies depending on the type of the algorithm.

\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
  \item[Example 1:] description = Loads selected data into the data manager. 
\end{description}
\end{quote}


\subsection*{menu\_path}
Specifies where on the menu an algorithm is to be
placed if a menu bar is used. Otherwise, it can act as a primitive hierarchical
classification of the algorithm. The string is a ``/'' separated list with
each element in the list getting more specific. The last element in the list
specifies a group for grouping algorithms in its final menu. Possible groups
include: ``additions'' for default placement, ``start'' for being placed at
the start of the menu, or ``end'' for being placed at the end of the menu.

\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
  \item[Example 1:] menu\_path = File/additions
  \item[Example 2:] menu\_path = Analysis/Undirected Networks/start
  \item[Example 3:] menu\_path = Visualization/Networks/end
\end{description}
\end{quote}


\subsection*{conversion}
For converter algorithms, this metadata element specifies if any data is
lost in the conversion. Possible values are ``lossy'' and ``lossless''. A
description of what type of information is lost should be given in the
``description'' metadata field.

\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
  \item[Example 1:] conversion = lossy 
\end{description}
\end{quote}


\subsection*{authors}
A comma separated list of the authors of the abstract algorithm.

\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
  \item[Example 1:] authors = Bruce W. Herr II
  \item[Example 2:] authors = Bruce W. Herr II, Weixia Huang, Katy Borner 
\end{description}
\end{quote}


\subsection*{implementers}
A comma separated list of the developers who implemented the algorithm in code.

\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
  \item[Example 1:] implementers = Bruce W. Herr II
  \item[Example 2:] implementers = Bruce W. Herr II, Weixia Huang, Katy Borner 
\end{description}
\end{quote}


\subsection*{integrators}
A comma separated list of the developers who integrated the algorithm code as
a compliant cishell algorithm.

\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
  \item[Example 1:] integrators = Bruce W. Herr II
  \item[Example 2:] integrators = Bruce W. Herr II, Weixia Huang, Katy Borner 
\end{description}
\end{quote}
