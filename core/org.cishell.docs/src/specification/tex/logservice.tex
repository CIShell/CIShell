\chapter{Log Service Specification}
\label{logService}
\section*{Version 1.3}
\section{Introduction}

CIShell requires OSGi's standard \class{LogService} to be installed in a
CIShell-compliant system. This gives both the algorithms and the applications
built on CIShell a standard logging sytem to use. This service has not been
extended or modified. More information about the \class{LogService} is available
in the OSGi Service Platform Service Compendium Specification R4, section 101
under ``Log Service Specification.'' Recommended output per log level for
CIShell algorithms are listed in table \ref{table:logLevels}.

\begin{table}[htb!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l p{12cm}}
\textbf{Log Level} & \textbf{Recommended Use} \\
LOG\_DEBUG & Used for problem determination and may be irrelevent to anyone but
the algorithm developer. \\
LOG\_ERROR & Indicates a problem occurred while the algorithm was executing.
Indicators of possible fixes should be output to this level along with
relevent information describing what went wrong, if possible. \\
LOG\_INFO & Used for providing information about and while the algorithm is
executing. It does not indicate a problem. \\
LOG\_WARNING & Indicates that the algorithm will still be executed, but
that outputs may not be what was expected. This is often in response to
illogical, but still valid user inputs.
