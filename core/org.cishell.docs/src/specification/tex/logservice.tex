\section{Introduction}

CIShell requires OSGi's standard \class{LogService} to be installed in a
CIShell-compliant system. This gives both the algorithms and the applications
built on CIShell a standard logging sytem to use. This service has not been
extended or modified. More information about the \class{LogService} is available
in the OSGi Service Platform Service Compendium Specification R4, section 101
under ``Log Service Specification''.
