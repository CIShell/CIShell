\chapter{GUI Builder Service Specification}
\section*{\textit{Version 1.0}}
\section{Introduction}

The GUI Builder Service provides a user-interface-agnostic solution to create UIs
for simple user input. The UIs are built from the user interface specification
provided by \class{MetaTypeProvider} and requires no UI coding to be done other
than providing an implementation of \class{MetaTypeProvider}. Information on
creating these classes can be found in section \ref{GUISpec}. In addition, simple
methods for creating warnings, pop-ups, and simple yes/no dialog boxes are
provided by the GUI Builder Service. The GUI creation workflow is illustrated in
figure \ref{fig:guiCreationWorkflow}.
