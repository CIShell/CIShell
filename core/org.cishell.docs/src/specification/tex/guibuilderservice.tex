\chapter{GUI Builder Service Specification}
\section*{\textit{Version 1.0}}
\section{Introduction}

The GUI Builder Service provides a user-interface-agnostic solution to
create UIs for simple user input. The UIs are built from the user interface
specification provided by \class{MetaTypeProvider} and requires no UI coding to
be done other than providing an implementation of \class{MetaTypeProvider}.
Information on creating these classes can be found in section \ref{GUISpec}. In
addition to this, simple methods for creating warnings, pop-ups, and
simple yes/no dialog boxes are provided by the GUI Builder Service.
