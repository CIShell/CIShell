\section{Introduction}

The org.cishell.framework package and subpackages define the core of CIShell. The
key components being algorithms, data, and CIShell service access.

\subsection{Essentials}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Application Independence} - Algorithms must be usable in a wide
  variety of contexts and should not be tied to any one front end where
  possible.
  \item \textit{Delayed Execution} - There may be a large delay between an
  algorithm getting parameters for execution and its actual execution.
  \item \textit{Remote Execution} - Algorithm interfaces should be designed to
  facilitate remote execution of algorithms where possible.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Entities}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{AlgorithmFactory} - The service interface for algorithms.
  A factory class which creates an Algorithm for execution from input data.
  \item \textit{Algorithm} - The interface for the code execution part of the
  algorithm.
  \item \textit{AlgorithmProperty} - The interface which provides string
  constants for an algorithm's service metadata.
  \item \textit{DataValidator} - The interface an AlgorithmFactory extends to
  provide additional data validation in addition to the data format validation
  that an application should provide ahead of time.
  \item \textit{ProgressTrackable} - The interface an Algorithm extends to allow
  for more detailed monitoring and control of an Algorithm's progress while
  executing.
  \item \textit{ProgressMonitor} - The interface for a class to be passed in to
  a ProgressTrackable Algorithm so that the Algorithm can be controlled
  and provide information on its progress while executing.
  \item \textit{Data} - The interface used to pass data (other than
  parameters) and meta-data between algorithms.
  \item \textit{BasicData} - A simple implementation of the Data interface. 
  \item \textit{DataProperty} - The interface which provides string constants
  for Data's metadata.
  \item \textit{CIShellContext} - The interface for a class to be passed in to
  an AlgorithmFactory for us in gaining access to standard CIShell services.
  \item \textit{LocalCIShellContext} - A simple implementation of the
  CIShellContext interface which pulls CIShell services from the OSGi Service
  Registry.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Operations}

The algorithm developer should fully implement the AlgorithmFactory interface and
make it available in OSGi's Service Registry. The system developer will provide
the services required by CIShell in OSGi's Service Registry. Application
developers will provide everything else, orchestrating the passing of information
between algorithms.
