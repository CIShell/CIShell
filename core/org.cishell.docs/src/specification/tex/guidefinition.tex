\subsection{Introduction}

For many algorithms, just looking at the data given isn't enough. Additional
parameters are often needed to know how to operate on a given piece of data. An
algorithm can define what parameters are needed by providing a
\class{MetaTypeProvider}. It defines the types, value range, and textual
description of the parameters needed. From this information, a user interface
(UI) can be created that asks a user for the data. The \class{MetaTypeProvider}
is not tied to any specific UI, so it can be reused depending on the context
(desktop application, web application, command line, etc.).

\class{MetaTypeProvider} is defined in the OSGi R4 Specification Service
Compendium as part of the Meta Type Service. \class{MetaTypeProvider}s can be
created in code or can be specified in an xml file (as defined in the
specification) and pulled out of the \class{MetaTypeService} service. A
\class{MetaTypeProvider} can be thought of as a collection of UIs. Each UI is
called an \class{ObjectClassDefinition}, which provides a UI name and
description and is a collection of parameters. Each parameter is an
\class{AttributeDefinition} which includes the type, label, description, default
value, and range of valid values. Drop-down boxes can also be defined by using
option labels and values with the \class{AttributeDefinition}. OSGi's
documentation should be consulted for more information.

\subsection{MetaTypeProvider Extensions}

Some minor extensions to \class{MetaTypeProvider} were made to support some
use cases. The \class{MetaTypeProvider} supports several simple types such as
strings, integers, booleans, etc, but several useful types are missing. Two
such types are files and directories. To get a file or a directory as input,
create an \class{AttributeDefinition} with string as its type and with ``file:``
or ``directory:`` (respectively) as its default value. When the algorithm is
run it will receive a \class{String} which is the absolute path to a file or
directory.
