\chapter{Scheduler Application Service Specification}

\section*{Version 1.0}

\section{Introduction}

The Scheduler Service is an optional service designed for application developers
to schedule algorithms for later monitoring and execution. Algorithm developers
may use this too if they wish, but it is not guaranteed to be available across
all CIShell-compliant systems.

\subsection{Entities}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{SchedulerService} - The service interface for scheduling
  algorithms to be monitored and executed.
  \item \textit{SchedulerListener} - The interface for listening to events
  generated by the \class{SchedulerService}.
  \item \textit{SchedulerAdapter} - This abstract class is an adapter
  implementation of \class{SchedulerListener} with empty method
  implementations.
\end{itemize}
