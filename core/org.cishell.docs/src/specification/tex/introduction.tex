\chapter{Introduction}

The Cyberinfrastructure Shell (CIShell) is an open source, community-driven
platform for the integration and utilization of datasets, algorithms, tools, and
computing resources. It is built specifically to enable (1) algorithm developers
to write and disseminate their algorithms in their favorite programming language
while retaining their intellectual rights after distribution; (2) data holders to
easily disseminate their data for use by others; (3) application developers to
design applications from custom sets of algorithms and datasets that interoperate
seamlessly; and ultimately (4) end-users to use existing datasets and algorithms
effectively.

\section{CIShell Platform Overview}

The CIShell Platform consists of Java interface definitions of algorithms, data,
services for algorithm developers, and services for application developers. Much
of the platform uses metadata and is fully defined.

%The next version should have this section.
%\section{What is New}

%This is the first release of the CIShell Platform Specification. Future
%versions will strive for backwards compatibility.

\section{Reader Level}

This specification is written for the following audiences:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Java algorithm developers
  \item Non-Java algorithm developers
  \item Framework and system service developers (system developers)
  \item Application developers building on CIShell
\end{itemize}

The CIShell Specifications assume that the reader has at least one year of
practical experience in writing Java programs. CIShell is built to run on the
OSGi Service Platform Release 4\footnote{http://www.osgi.org/Release4/Download}
and thus a working knowledge of OSGi is expected. OSGi (and thus CIShell) is highly dynamic and must be taken into consideration
when developing anything on CIShell.

Non-Java algorithm developers may not need to know any Java and should be mainly
concerned with the metadata definitions for algorithms and data. They may also
need to be aware of OSGi and the other services CIShell provides, but more than
likely will not directly interact with them.

\section{Conventions and Terms}

In this specification, algorithms are referred to in three different contexts. An
abstract algorithm, is the pure idea of the algorithm with no actual source code.
It is a series of steps sometimes put into psuedo-code and often published in
academic journals. An \class{Algorithm} with a capital A refers to the Java class
called Algorithm. And finally, an algorithm with a lowercase A refers to the
bundle of code and metadata that encompasses an algorithm written to work with
the CIShell Platform. This includes the implementation of
\class{AlgorithmFactory} and \class{Algorithm}, and the metadata, files, and
other code that go into an OSGi bundle.

All other conventions and terms are exactly the same as from OSGi's Core
Specification, section 1.4.

\section{Version Information}

This is the first release of the CIShell Platform Specification. All packages are
at 1.0 for this release. Subsequent releases may increase the version number of
specific packages if changes have been made.
