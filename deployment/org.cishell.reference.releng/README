CIShell Release Engineering Project
-----------------------------------
Initial version by Bruce Herr building on the Eclipse PluginBuilder project.

Getting Eclipse to play nicely is a severe challenge. Hopefully, all that is 
documented here continues to work for at least a couple versions.

The following sections assume that you just follow the model of whatever
file is pointed to in there. Its a pain in the butt, but generally it works.

==
Files that will need edited as new versions come out:
releases/HEAD.properties

==
Files that will need edited as new plugins/features are added:
maps/all.map
build-files/fetchSvnAll.xml

NOTE: for build-files/fetchSvnAll.xml if you do not want to pull from svn, but
simply want to copy a local copy, use a copy command instead. This is sometimes
helpful when you need to debug features/plugins (though you should try to 
minimize this by exporting from the product file in the Eclipse IDE before
trying to update the releng project).

==
Files that will need edited as new platforms are added:
build-files/customTargets.xml
build-files/allElements.xml

== 
Files that will need edited for different brands:
cishell.product
build-files/build.properties

==
NOTE: pluginbuilder.config is basically useless now that I have customized 
the project.

NOTE: Unfortunately buildHome will need to be set in build_local.properties 
depending on where the project is checked out at.

NOTE: You should also check out org.cishell.reference.releng.eclipse for the
current base eclipse builder.
