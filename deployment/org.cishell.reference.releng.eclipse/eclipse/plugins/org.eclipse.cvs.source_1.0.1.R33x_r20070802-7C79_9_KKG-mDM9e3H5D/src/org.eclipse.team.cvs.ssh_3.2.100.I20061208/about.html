<h4>The Blowfish Encryption Algorithm</h4>
<p>The following classes in the package org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ssh in the plug-in JAR are based on an algorithm developed by Bruce Schneier.
The algorithm was originally published in a paper that is located at <a href="http://www.counterpane.com/bfsverlag.html">http://www.counterpane.com/bfsverlag.html</a>.
Your use of the Blowfish Encryption Algorithm in both source and binary code form contained in the plug-in is not subject to any
additional terms and conditions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Blowfish</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cryptography</h3>

<h4>Export Control</h4>
<p>The plug-in contains encryption software.  The country in which you are currently may have restrictions on the import, possession,
and use, and/or re-export to another country, of encryption software.  BEFORE using any encryption software, please check the country's
laws, regulations and policies concerning the import, possession, or use, and re-export of encryption software, to see if this
is permitted.</p>

<h4>Encryption Items</h4>

<p>Details of the encryption software in this plug-in are provided to assist in obtaining relevant export control classification and approval.
Cryptography in this plug-in has been deemed eligible by the U.S. Government Department of Commerce for export under License Exception Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) for both object code and source code.</p>

<p>The plug-in contains an implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol that encrypts the network traffic (program code files
in file versioning systems) between a Concurrent Versions System (CVS) server and a CVS client.  Data is encrypted using the Blowfish algorithm
which is a 64-bit symmetric cipher that uses a key varying in length from 32 bits to 448 bits.  The RSA PKCS #1 v1.5 key exchange algorithm is
used to authenticate and exchange keys with a minimum modulus size of 96 bits and a maximum modulus size theoretically unlimited since the
implementation uses the java.math.BigInteger class which has a maximum positive integer range limited only by the available memory in the computer.
In practice, the key length is defined by the CVS server with which communication is initiated.</p>

<p>The following Java classes contain encryption items (the plug-in may contain both binary and source code):</p>

<ul>
	<li>org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ssh.Blowfish</li>
	<li>org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ssh.Cipher</li>
	<li>org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ssh.Client</li>
	<li>org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ssh.ClientPacket</li>
	<li>org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ssh.Misc</li>
