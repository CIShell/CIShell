CIShell Specification Project
-----------------------------
CIShell 1.0 specification and build system by Bruce Herr. The Javadoc->Latex 
doclet (TexDoclet) originally from https://texdoclet.dev.java.net/ was 
customized by Bruce Herr.

The build system was originally set up so that we could create the specification,
developer guide, and other CIShell related documents. We are now doing the 
developer guide at the CIShell Wiki ( https://cishell.org/?n=DevGuide.HomePage ).
The initial workings of the dev_guide using LaTeX is left here as an example of 
how another document could be integrated. 

USING THE BUILD SYSTEM:
Using ant, you will typically just run 'ant' and it'll build the spec. 
'ant clean' can be used to clean up the generated files. You can look at the 
build.xml file for other possible commands.

In order to inject the API docs into the specification, you must have the 
org.cishell.framework bundle checked out in the same directory as this project.
If you are in eclipse, then just check it out into your workspace. 'ant 
javadoc-tex' will invoke the javadoc command using the customized texdoclet 
which will create an api.tex file in src/specification/tex/.
