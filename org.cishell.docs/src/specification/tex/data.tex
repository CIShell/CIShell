\subsection{Introduction}

Data to be operated on is passed around in \class{Data} objects which hold the
real data, the data's format, and its properties (metadata). The data can be any
Java \class{Object}. The format is a string which is either a full Java class or
a mime type if it is a \class{java.lang.File}. The mime type corresponds to the
file's data type and has the following form - ``file:mime/type''. Note that if no
official mime type is available for a file format, a made up one can be used, but
must still conform to how mime types are constructed, see \comments{reference to
mime-type construction}. Finally, the properties help describe the data. The
label to give the data, the parent \class{Data} object from which it was derived
from, and a coarse data type can all be defined in the \class{Data}'s properties.
See the \class{DataProperty} interface definition for specific properties to use.
