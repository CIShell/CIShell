\chapter{Data Manager Application Service Specification}

\section*{\textit{Version 1.0}}

\section{Introduction}

The Data Manager Service is an optional service designed for application
developers to have a central \class{Data} management system. Algorithm
developers may use this too if they wish, but it is not guaranteed to be
available across all CIShell-compliant systems.

\subsection{Entities}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{DataManagerService} - The service interface for \class{Data}
  management.
  \item \textit{DataManagerListener} - The interface for listening to events
  generated by the \class{DataManagerService}.
  \item \textit{DataManagerAdapter} - This abstract class is an adapter
  implementation of \class{DataManagerListener} with empty method
  implementations.
  \item \textit{Data} - The interface used to pass data (other than
  parameters) and its metadata between algorithms.
\end{itemize}
