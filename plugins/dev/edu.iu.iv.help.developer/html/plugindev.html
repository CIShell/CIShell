			Environment) that can be used in the <a href="glossary.html#rcp" class="glossary_term">RCP</a>
			(Rich Client Platform) IVC framework 
			based off of a simple template can greatly simplify the learning curve of a

		<p class="subsection_heading">Getting Eclipse</p>				
		<p class="body_text">The first step in developing your new IVC plug-in 
			will be to download and install the <strong>Eclipse IDE with 
			PDE</strong> (Plug-in Development Environment) included. Of course, 
			if you already have Eclipse installed this section can be skipped. 
			PDE has been included with Eclipse to some extent since version 
			2.1, but this tutorial will be based off of the 3.0.1 version.</p>

		<a name="downloading" id="downloading" />
		<p class="subsubsection_heading">Downloading Eclipse</p>
		<p class="body_text">The latest releases of Eclipse can always be found 
			at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php"> 
			http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php</a> This page should 
			look something like the following:</p>
		<div align="center">
			<a href="images/plugindev/eclipse-download.png">
				<img src="images/plugindev/eclipse-download.png" alt="eclipse download site" class="figure" />
			</a>
			<div class="figurecaption">
				<p>Fig1: The Eclipse.org download site. (Click to Expand) </p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p class="body_text">From this page you can select one of the mirrors listed, 
			or simply scroll to the very bottom where it says "<a 
			href="http://download.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php">Main Eclipse 
			Download Site</a>" (or just click the previous link) to go to the main 
			download site if you don't want to bother with a mirror. Now you should be 
			confronted with the following page where you can select exactly what you 
			wish to download:</p>
		<div align="center">
			<a href="images/plugindev/eclipse-release.png">
				<img src="images/plugindev/eclipse-release.png" alt="available eclipse releases" class="figure" />
			</a>
			<div class="figurecaption">
				<p>Fig2: The available Eclipse releases for download. (Click to Expand) </p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p class="body_text">We will select the <strong>Latest Release</strong>, the 
			first item listed in the top section to download version 
			<strong>3.0.1</strong>. This will bring you to a page to allow you to 
			select the platform you wish to download Eclipse for (in the 
			<strong>Eclipse SDK</strong> section), where you can select whichever 
			operating system you are using. The download will now either begin, or 
			possibly involve selecting one of the mirrors listed if you are still 
			required to select a mirror. This download may take a little time since it 
			is rather large, but it will be worth it.</p>
		<p class="tip"> <strong>Trouble?</strong> Eclipse does not include a 
			<strong>Java runtime environment (JRE)</strong>. You will need a 1.4.1 
			level or higher <a 
			href="http://download.eclipse.org/downloads/drops/R-3.0.1-200409161125/java-runtimes.html"> 
			Java runtime</a> or Java development kit (JDK) installed on your machine 
			in order to run Eclipse. </p>

		<a name="installation" id="installation" />
		<p class="subsubsection_heading">Installation</p>
		<p class="body_text">Once the file has finished downloading, it is a matter of 
			extracting the files from whatever type of archive is downloaded (.zip 
			typically) to whatever location is desired (usually <code>C:\eclipse</code> 
			in Windows). This will result in the new directory structure that looks 
			something like this:</p>
		<div align="center">
			<a href="images/plugindev/eclipse-install-dir.png">
				<img src="images/plugindev/eclipse-install-dir.png" alt="eclipse install directory" class="figure" />
			</a>
			<div class="figurecaption">
				<p>Fig3: The Eclipse install directory. (Click to Expand) </p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p class="body_text">The important thing to find is the 
			<code>eclipse.exe</code> (or equivalent executable on other platforms) that 
			you can now double-click on to launch Eclipse for the first time. Just 
			select 'ok' to the defaults about workspace location unless you have a 
			preference. And then when confronted with the following welcome screen, 
			press the button in the top right that says <strong>Go to the 
			workbench</strong> (unless you wish to browse around at the other options 
			to learn more, they are always available through 
			<strong>Help->Welcome</strong>.</p>
		<div align="center">
			<a href="images/plugindev/eclipse-load.png">
				<img src="images/plugindev/eclipse-load.png" alt="eclipse welcome screen" class="figure" />
			</a>
			<div class="figurecaption">

			</div>
		</div>
		<p class="body_text">That's it, Eclipse is now up and running and we 
			are ready to move on to the job of actually creating plug-ins using 
			the Plug-in Development Environment and the custom IVC templates. 
			First we have to get the IVC Plug-in Development feature from the 
			IVC Update Site.</p>

		<p class="subsection_heading">Getting the IVC Plug-in Development Feature</p>
		<p class="body_text">
			To get the IVC Plug-in Development <a href="glossary.html#feature" class="glossary_term">
			Feature</a> from the IVC <a href="glossary.html#updatesite" class="glossary_term">
			Update Site</a>, we
			will use the Eclipse Update Manager tool from within Eclipse. To do this, go
			to <strong>Help->Software Updates->Find and Install...</strong> in the main
			menu of Eclipse.  In the dialog that comes up, choose <em>Search for new
			features to install</em> and press <strong>Next ></strong>.  Now we want
			to add the IVC Update Site to the list of sites in the dialog, so select
			<strong>New Remote Site...</strong> and give it a name and the URL:
			<code>http://ivc.sourceforge.net/update/</code> and press <strong>OK</strong>.

		<div align="center">
			<img src="images/update/3.png" alt="adding the IVC Update Site" class="figure" />
			<div class="figurecaption">
				<p>Fig5: Add the IVC Update Site.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p class="body_text">
			Now press the '+' next to the name that was given to the site to expand the
			tree of available categories to download from the IVC Update Site.
			Select the <strong>IVC Plug-in Development</strong> category and press
			<strong>Next ></strong> at the bottom of the screen and the tool will
			search for the selected features.
		</p>
		<p class="body_text">
			The tool should find the <strong>IVC Plug-in Development</strong> feature
			available for download.  Select this item and press <strong>Next ></strong>
			to continue.

			<img src="images/plugindev/plugindev-feature.png" alt="the IVC Plug-in Development feature" class="figure" />
			<div class="figurecaption">
				<p>Fig6: Selecting the IVC Plug-in Development Feature.</p>
			</div>
		</div>		
		<p class="body_text">
			Mark your acceptance of the licensing agreement, press <strong>Next ></strong>, and
			then validate the install location and press <strong>Finish</strong> to
			start installing the Plug-in Development feature.  When asked about
			jar verification for an unsigned feature, just press <strong>Install</strong>
			to continue.  This will install the IVC Plug-in Development templates
			that are used in the other tutorials in this guide to aid plug-in development
			as well as the underlying IVC core plug-ins that are needed for IVC development
			to plug into the core.  This is not an exhaustive set though, and it may
			be possible that something that you wish to extend from is not included.
			In this case, you will have to reconnect to the IVC Update Site and browse the
			available plug-ins to find what you need.  The Plug-in Development feature
			should have everything you need though for stardard plug-in development based
			on the items included in the core feature of IVC.
		</p>
		<p class="body_text">
			Restart Eclipse when asked, and continue on to one of the other tutorials
			for specific information about using one of the included templates.
