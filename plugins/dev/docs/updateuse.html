		<p class="subsection_heading">Getting New Features</p>
		<p class="body_text">
			The first topic to cover with the Software Update Tool is how
			to use the provided tool in the IVC distribution to update
			your plug-in configuration.  When IVC is first launched, the
			Help menu will contain the necessary menu items to use the tool.
		</p>			
		<div align="center">
				<img src="images/update/1.png" alt="IVC help menu" class="figure" />
			<div class="figurecaption">
				<p>Fig1: The IVC Help menu.  Notice the menu items for <strong>Update...</strong>
					and <strong>Manage Configuration...</strong> which are used to
					launch the Software Update Tool utilities.</p>
			</div>
		</div>			
		<p class="body_text">
			First, select <strong>Update...</strong> from the Help menu.  This will
			open up the Install/Update dialog.  We will first look at how to get
			new features from an existing 
			<a href="glossary.html#updatesite" class="glossary_term">update site</a>, 
			so select <em>"Search for new
			features to install"</em> and press <strong>Next ></strong>.
		</p>
		<div align="center">
			<img src="images/update/2.png" alt="Install/Update dialog" class="figure" />
			<div class="figurecaption">
				<p>Fig2: The Install/Update dialog is where you specify whether
					you want to look for new features or update existing features.</p>
			</div>
		</div>					
		<p class="body_text">
			In the next dialog, we must specify where we want to look for new features.
			If this is the first time the tool is run, there will be no sites listed.
			Click the <strong>New Remote Site...</strong> button and a dialog will appear
			asking for a name and URL.  We will add the IVC update site, so put in a name
			such as <em>IVC Update Site</em> and the URL: <code>http://ivc.sourceforge.net/update</code>
			and press <strong>OK</strong>.
		</p>
		<div align="center">
			<img src="images/update/3.png" width="356" alt="adding a new site" class="figure" />
			<div class="figurecaption">
				<p>Fig3: Specify a name and insert the URL in the figure to add the IVC
					Update Site to the Update tool.</p>
			</div>
		</div>		
		<p class="body_text">
			Now that we have a site, press the '+' to the left of the name of the newly added site
			to expand the tree view of what categories of items are available.  For this demonstration
			we will choose <em>IVC Plug-ins</em> and press <strong>Next ></strong>.  The tool
			will then search the site for items in that category, and list whatever is available that
			we do not already have in the next dialog.
		</p>
		<div align="center">
			<img src="images/update/4.png" alt="browsing available plug-ins" class="figure" />
			<div class="figurecaption">
				<p>Fig4: The tool finds all available plug-ins in the categories specified.  This
					figure shows an example of what this might look like for a particular
					configuration, results will vary.</p>
			</div>
		</div>		
		<p class="body_text">
			We can now simply pick one of the plug-ins that we want to add to our configuration.
			If a dependency is not met, the tool will signify next to that plug-in when we select it
			that we need to also select a dependency if we wish to use that plug-in. By highlighting
			a plug-in and pressing the <strong>Properties</strong> button, more information about the
			plug-in can be obtained.  After selecting one of the plug-ins, press <strong>Next ></strong>
			to continue the installation.  Mark your acceptance of the terms of the license agreement
			for the plug-in and press <strong>Next ></strong>.  Finally, verify the installation
			location is where you desired, this should be the installation location of IVC, and press
			<strong>Finish</strong> to install.  The tool may ask about jar verification if the feature
			has not been digitally signed.
		</p>
		<p>
			The tool will complete the installation and then ask if you wish to restart the application
			for changes to take effect.  It is best to say <strong>Yes</strong> here, and then simply
			relaunch IVC to use the new plug-in.  You should notice new menu items corresponding to the
			features that were added.  Some plug-ins will also have corresponding Sample Data plug-ins
			that are available on the update site to provide some input files that can be loaded in
			IVC with a Persister to demonstrate the functionality of a plug-in.

		<p class="subsection_heading">Updating Existing Features</p>
		<p class="body_text">
			When a feature has been added to IVC in the past, but the developer
			has made an update available in the form of a new version of the feature,
			the Software Update Tool can be used to perform this upgrade in a
			standardized fashion.  To do so, we select the same menu item as above,
			<strong>Update...</strong> from the Help menu.  This will
			open up the Install/Update dialog.  Now select <em>"Search for updates
			of the currently installed features"</em> and press <strong>Next ></strong>.
		</p>
		<div align="center">
			<img src="images/update/10.png" alt="update existing features" class="figure" />
			<div class="figurecaption">
				<p>Fig5: To search for updates of existing features, select
					<em>"Search for updates of the currently installed features".</em></p>
			</div>
		</div>			
		<p class="body_text">
			The tool will now scan all of the installed features to look for updates.
			The next screen will show the results.  It should be noted 
			that the results are based somewhat
			on the prefences specifed in the <strong>File->Preferences</strong> dialog of
			IVC, in the <strong>Install/Update</strong> category.  The <em>Valid updates</em>
			section determines whether only service updates of the same primary version,
			i.e. an update from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2, are the only updates to allow, or whether
			minor incremental updates should also be allowed, such as an update from
			1.0.9 to 1.1.0.  This is really dependent on the actual developer of the feature
			and what they have changed, but in general it should be considered safe to allow
			minor incremental updates as long as all other dependencies are met.
		</p>
		<p class="body_text">
			If a desired update is found, the process of upgrading is nearly identical to
			that of aquiring a new feature.  Select the updates that are desired and
			proceed through the installation as described in the section above.

		<p class="subsection_heading">Managing the Configuration</p>
		<p class="body_text">
			The update tool allows a means for managing the current plug-in
			configuration from inside of the IVC application as well.  By selecting
			<strong>Manage Configuration...</strong> in the Help menu of IVC, a dialog
			will show the current plug-in configuration.

			This dialog allows you do perform various activites on the selected
			features.  If you wish to uninstall, or just simply disable, but not
			completely remove a feature, this dialog allows for this choice.  This
			dialog also has a quick link to scan for updates of a selected feature,
			as well as a link to look at the properties defined for that feature.
